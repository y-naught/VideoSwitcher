# VideoSwitcher
This sketch acts as a switcher between videos for purposes of switchable projections

I created this particular sketch to dynamically control what is being projected on a video feed during live music performances  in conjunction with a DMX software for full lighting control.

Currently this application will support up to 8 videos. A simple copy and paste operation can allow you to apply more videos. 

I am not aware of the maximum nnumber of files you could put into this operation. 

This particular sketch could be worked into an object orientated notation, in time I will rework this sketch for efficency / malleability.
